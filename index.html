 <h2>sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
 
 <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying business administration with a 
minor in aviation. I work for a catering company that helps with weddings and other events.</p>
 <p>
 I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my 
local church: University baptist church Clemson, SC. I teach Sunday School for the 
College &amp; Career group and I run the Sound / Video Projection System during 
services. I also drive the church bus for weekend activities.
 </p>
 <p>
 I also enjoy baseball, flying, the gym, fishing and hanging out with friends.
